## Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Forecast

# Data
Bitcoin's historical price can be found through varying degrees on multiple locations. I chose to use yahoo finance as it obtained the a large history of the coin dating back to September of 2014 from the following link. The date range has to be manually set before it can be retrieved.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Most of the datset was already organized and cleaned, 5 days had missing information and were dropped. 

# Preprocessing and Training

# Modeling
Facebook's Prophet was used for forecasting. The model was fit to the entire dataset and used to preduct the next 100 days.
